COMP 542 PROJECT 2 -- CLASSIFYING MOVIE REVIEWS

Please submit your answers as a text file on the course website.  There
are a total of 4 problems worth 100 points which should take you around
3 minutes / point.  The due date is October 27.  Please start early and
use the class mailing list to clarify your questions.


1. CORPORA

Please download the polarity dataset v2.0 from

http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data

Read (Pang and Lee, 2002) available from the same page if you have not
done so already.

[5 points] What is the average number of tokens in positive reviews?
What is the average number of tokens in negative reviews?  Is there a
trend?

[5 points] What are the most frequent 20 words used in positive reviews?
What are the most frequent 20 words used in negative reviews?  Is there
a pattern?

2. NAIVE BAYES

[30 points] Implement the simple Naive Bayes algorithm discussed in
class with add-one smoothing in your favorite language.  Include your
code in the submission.  Evaluate your algorithm by training with 80% of
the data and testing on the remaining 20%.  Try this with five random
80-20 train-test splits.  What is the average accuracy?  What is the
standard deviation?

3. SRILM

[30 points] Naive Bayes can be seen as learning simple unigram language
models for each class.  In our first project we learned how to build
more sophisticated language models using SRILM.  For each of the five
training sets used in the last problem, build a language model for
positive reviews and another language model for negative reviews.  Use
trigram models with interpolated Kneser-Ney smoothing, the -unk option,
and the vocabulary set to all words that appear more than once in the
whole polarity dataset.  Use the corresponding test sets to evaluate
this language model based learner.  What is the average accuracy?  What
is the standard deviation?  Is the difference with Naive Bayes
statistically significant?

4. LOG-LINEAR

[30 points] Build and evaluate a conditional log-linear model using the
same five train-test splits.  Use two types of binary features as
discussed in class: class-only features that are active for a particular
class, and class-word features that are active for a particular
class-word pair.  You have three choices of increasing difficulty for
building the models, pick one:

- Use a package like liblinear, mallet, R, or weka that implements
  logistic regression (another name for conditional log-linear models
  with binary output).  You will only need to figure out how to use the
  package and convert the data to its input format.

- Write your own log-linear learner based on the class notes but use an
  external package like libLBFGS for optimization.  (This would be
  better for understanding the model.)

- Implement the whole thing (including optimization) on your own.  (This
  is probably unnecessarily difficult.)
